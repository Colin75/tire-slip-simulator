## Tire slip simulator

The purpose of this package is to generate a dataset from the Pacejka Magic Formula.  
It includes both the modeling/simulation of a 1D wheel tire slip and a generator to 
create dataset with pseudo-random sequences. For each sequence two quantities are given :  
- True velocity, meaning without slippage. 
- Wheel velocity, which includes slippage.
